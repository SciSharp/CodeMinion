# CodeMinion
A code generator framework written by the SciSharp team to generate the APIs of several SciSharp libraries. You code the intersting parts, the minion writes the rest for you.

The framework consists of code generator named **The Minion**.

## The Minion
The Minion is capable of generating the source code of entire libraries from model definitions and is currently specialized on wrapping Python libraries using Pythonnet. The model definitions are usually harvested off of HTML documentation pages. 

### Generated by the Minion
These libraries have been generated by CodeMinion from Python docs:
* [Numpy.NET](https://github.com/SciSharp/Numpy.NET) ... 39,103 lines of code (mostly done)
* [Torch.NET](https://github.com/SciSharp/Torch.NET) ... 10,767 lines of code (work in progress)
* [Keras.NET](https://github.com/SciSharp/Keras.NET) ... 7,573 lines of code (mostly done)
* [SpaCy.NET](https://github.com/SciSharp/SpaCy.NET) ... (work in progress)

### Contributing to CodeMinion
Any help is appreciated. If you fix bugs or improve anything please send a PR.

* Be sure not to make manual changes in generated files! Instead the generator has to be fixed
* When changing the generator, generate the code for all generated projects (i.e. Numpy.NET and Torch.NET) and check the changes in the generated code (i.e. by looking over the git diff) to see that nothing broke. 
* When you check in changes in the generator, please also check in the changes it has on the generated code.
