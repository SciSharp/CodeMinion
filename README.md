These libraries have been generated by CodeMinion from Python docs:
* [Numpy.NET](https://github.com/SciSharp/Numpy.NET) ... generated 39,103 lines of code (mostly done)
* [Torch.NET](https://github.com/SciSharp/Torch.NET) ... generated 10,767 lines of code (work in progress)
* [Keras.NET](https://github.com/SciSharp/Keras.NET) ... (mostly done)
* [SpaCy.NET](https://github.com/SciSharp/SpaCy.NET) ... (work in progress)
